# Crystal_Structures

A collection of crystal structures from first-principles simulations.

Spinels
======
Normal and inverse spinel structures (fcc primitive unit cells). The normal spinel structure is an ordered lattice of A(tetrahedral)B(octahedral)2O4, while the inverse spinel structure is a disordered lattice of B(tetrahedral)AB(octahedral)O4. Site disorder in the inverse structure requires special treatment: we generated a representative structure using the SQS method (see http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Engineering/Labs/avdw/atat/).

BiVO4
=====
Crystal structure of bismuth vanadate. Taken from ICSD record #33243 (1983). Note that the structure was originally reported in a non-standard setting (the monoclinic angle is set to gamma). To make more compatible with the lattice symmetry in VASP, the cell was transformed into a standard C2/C setting (the cell volume remains unchanged, but the monoclinic angle becomes beta). In some publications, the angles of gamma and beta are erroneously switched.
