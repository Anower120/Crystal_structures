# Crystal Structures

A collection of crystal structures optimised from first-principles simulations of functional materials.

[V-VI-VII](V-VI-VII)
------
Crystal structures of Sb-based photoactive ferroelectric semiconductors using PBEsol.

[Antimony Sulfides](XSbS)
------
Crystal structures of Sb2S3, Cs2Sb8S13 and (CH3NH3)2Sn8S13 optimised using PBEsol.
#####Used in

[BiVO4](BiVO4)
------
Crystal structure of bismuth vanadate. Taken from ICSD record #33243 (1983). Note that the structure was originally reported in a non-standard setting (the monoclinic angle is set to gamma). To make more compatible with the lattice symmetry in VASP, the cell was transformed into a standard C2/C setting (the cell volume remains unchanged, but the monoclinic angle becomes beta). In some publications, the angles of gamma and beta are erroneously switched.

[Kesterites](Kesterites)
------
Crystal structures for the kesterite and stannite forms of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS). The structures were optimised using the PW91 (2009 data) or PBEsol / HSE06 (2015 data) exchange-correlation functional. Note that most of these files correspond to the conventional unit cells (16 atoms per cell), while a primitive cell (8 atoms per cell) also exists.

[MOFs](MOFs)
------
Crystal structures of a range of metal-organic frameworks. 

###### MIL-125: The structure reported by Dan Hardi et al. in 2009 (DOI: 10.1021/ja903726m) from X-ray diffraction contained no hydrogen positions. Multiple configurations were tested, with the final structure (Ti16C96O72H56) resulting in a large electronic band gap.

[Perovskites](https://github.com/WMD-Bath/Hybrid-perovskites)
------
Organic-inorganic perovskite structured materials are covered in their [own repository](https://github.com/WMD-Bath/Hybrid-perovskites).


[Spinels](Spinels)
------
Normal and inverse spinel structures (fcc primitive unit cells). The normal spinel structure is an ordered lattice of A(tetrahedral)B(octahedral)2O4, while the inverse spinel structure is a disordered lattice of B(tetrahedral)AB(octahedral)O4. Site disorder in the inverse structure requires special treatment: we generated a representative structure using the SQS method (see http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Engineering/Labs/avdw/atat/).
