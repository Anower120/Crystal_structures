# Crystal Structures

A collection of crystal structures optimised from first-principles calculations.

[V-VI-VII](V-VI-VII)
------
Crystal structures of Sb-based photoactive ferroelectric semiconductors using DFT/PBEsol.

[Antimony Sulfides](XSbS)
------
Crystal structures of Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, Cs<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>8</sub>S<sub>13</sub> and (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Sn<sub>8</sub>S<sub>13</sub> optimised using DFT/PBEsol.

[BiVO4](BiVO4)
------
Crystal structure of bismuth vanadate. Taken from ICSD record #33243 (1983). Note that the structure was originally reported in a non-standard setting (the monoclinic angle is set to gamma). To make more compatible with the lattice symmetry in VASP, the cell was transformed into a standard C2/c setting (the cell volume remains unchanged, but the monoclinic angle becomes beta). In some publications, the angles of gamma and beta are erroneously switched.

[Kesterites](Kesterites)
------
Crystal structures for the kesterite and stannite forms of Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSnS<sub>4</sub> (CZTS). The structures were optimised using the PW91 (2009 data) or PBEsol / HSE06 (2015 data) exchange-correlation functional. Note that most of these files correspond to the conventional unit cells (16 atoms per cell), while a primitive cell (8 atoms per cell) also exists.

[MOFs](MOFs)
------
Crystal structures for a range of metal-organic frameworks. 

###### MIL-125: The structure reported by Dan Hardi et al. in 2009 (DOI: 10.1021/ja903726m) from X-ray diffraction contained no hydrogen positions. Multiple configurations were tested, with the final structure (Ti16C96O72H56) resulting in a large electronic band gap.

[Perovskites](https://github.com/WMD-Group/Hybrid-perovskites)
------
Organic-inorganic perovskite structured materials are covered in their [own repository](https://github.com/WMD-Group/Hybrid-perovskites).


[Platinium Compounds](Platinum)
------
PBEsol relaxed structure of a conductive Pt(II) double salt crystallised by the group of Ken Sakai.

[Spinels](Spinels)
------
Normal and inverse spinel structures (fcc primitive unit cells). 
The normal spinel structure is an ordered lattice of A(tetrahedral)B(octahedral)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, while the inverse spinel structure is a disordered lattice of B(tetrahedral)AB(octahedral)O<sub>4</sub>. 
Site disorder in the inverse structure requires special treatment: we generated a representative structure using the SQS method (see http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Engineering/Labs/avdw/atat/).
