# Crystal_Structures

A collection of crystal structures from first-principles simulations.

Spinel
======
Normal and inverse spinel structures (fcc primitive unit cells). The normal spinel structure is an ordered lattice of A(tetrahedral)B(octahedral)2O4, while the inverse spinel structure is a disordered lattice of B(tetrahedral)AB(octahedral)O4. Site disorder in the inverse structure requires special treatment: we generated a representative structure using the SQS method (see http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Engineering/Labs/avdw/atat/).
