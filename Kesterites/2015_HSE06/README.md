## Settings
A full geometry optimisation (ISIF=3 to allow volume relaxation as well as ionic relaxation) of a CZTS primitive unit cell was performed in the code VASP.

* KPOINTS 6x6x6 mesh (Gamma-centred)
* ENCUT 550 eV

The primitive unit cell was optimised, and the converged structure was converted to the conventional cell using Materials Studio.
